// FilterDrum - parameter definitions

// THREE RANGES PER PARAMETER, even though this plug-in is brand new and
// has one parameter. The shape is inherited from the DXi ports in this
// folder and is kept on purpose:
//
//   normalised   0..1, what VST3 automates and what the host stores
//   plain        what the USER sees - the number on the panel and in the
//                host's own generic editor
//   internal     what the DSP is handed, via toInternal()
//
// A Cakewalk DXi kept the last two explicitly - an "external" range in
// Parameters.h and an "internal" one reached through
// CParamEnvelope::MapToInternal - and a port has to reproduce both or
// the numbers on screen stop matching the original.
//
// FOR THIS PROJECT INTERNAL == PLAIN. Every parameter below sets
// internalMin/internalMax equal to plainMin/plainMax, so toInternal()
// returns the same number as toPlain(). THE SLOT IS EMPTY, NOT ABSENT -
// that is the point of saying so here. The first parameter ported in
// from a DXi will need its own internal range, and this is the machinery
// for it rather than something to invent then.
//
// Note what is NOT a range mapping: dB to linear gain. That is the DSP's
// arithmetic and lives in FilterDrumDsp.h, where the editor can call the
// same copy of it.

	    the host's generic editor agree about what it says. A scaffold

	    1000, DELIBERATELY FAR PAST THE END OF THE TABLE, and this is the
	    trap it exists to make obvious. kParams is indexed by ParamID,
	    and every id that reaches an index must be range-checked first -
	    paramDef() below is the only place that indexing happens, and it
	    is the only place that check has to be right. An unchecked
	    kParams[kBypass] reads 1000 entries past a one-entry array.
	
	    Any "enabled" switch a ported DXi had stays SEPARATE from this,
	    with its own original default. They are not the same control:
	    kIsBypass is the host's, and the host expects it to pass audio
	    through untouched.
	
	    IDs 1001 upwards are the space for READ-ONLY OUTPUT parameters -
	    the mechanism for a value the DSP computes per block that the
	    panel needs. That is what they are for and not messages: a
	    sendMessage from process() is silently discarded by the host's
	    connection proxy (see FilterDrumIDs.h), whereas
	    data.outputParameterChanges is delivered on the UI thread and
	    cannot be lost. Nothing publishes one yet. */
